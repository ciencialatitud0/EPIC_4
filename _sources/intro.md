# IV Escuela de Programación para Investigación Científica (EPIC)
## "EPIC 4: Data analysis and machine learning for physical and life sciences"

Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) jointly with Grupo de Investigadores Latitud Cero, Universidad International del Ecuador - UIDE, the School of Physical Sciences and Nanotechnology of Yachay Tech University, and the Physics Department of Escuela Politécnica Nacional in Ecuador are pleased to announce our upcoming summer "School of Programming for Scientific Research - EPIC 4: Data analysis and machine learning for physical and life sciences".

## General Information

The 4th edition of EPIC will focus on introducing computational techniques for the analysis of scientific data and images by using the programming languages (python, matlab, mathematica) as tools. Instructors will present real research problems to illustrate the use of computational tools in the experimental or theoretical study of physical systems. Basic programming notions are essential to sign up for this workshop.

The tutorials will focus on the following areas:

 * data and image analysis
 * machine learning
 * astrophysics and cosmology
 * biophysics
 * particle physics
 * materials science
 * fluid dynamics

### EPIC 4, a Physics Without Frontiers program:

EPIC 4 is kindly supported and funded by ICTP's Physics Without Frontiers (PWF) program and UNESCO-Quito. If you would like to know more about the PWF team, please have a look at their ongoing and previous projects:

## Eligibility
We welcome applications from undergraduate students, MSc students, and early-career professionals working on any field of natural sciences and/or computer sciences and who wish to expand their scientific computing skills. While we will review all applications, we will give preference to applicants from Latin American countries (owing to the limited available funds) and to students who have not participated in previous editions of EPIC. **We are also fully committed to reducing the existing gender gap in academia, so half of our scholarships will be allocated to female applicants. Female applicants are particularly welcome to apply, and we will have a dedicated session on Women in STEM as part of EPIC 4.**

## Goals and deliverables
The 4th edition of EPIC will focus on introducing techniques for data analysis and image processing using Python and other programming languages as the main tools. EPIC 4 will have plenary talks on various topics and dedicated tutorials on simulation and data analysis in physics, machine learning for physics and life sciences, observational astronomy and computational astrophysics, high-energy (particle) physics, and materials science. By the end of this school, participants will have the ability to perform basic data analysis on unprocessed raw data and images to extract important information about physical systems. Participants will also have the opportunity to present their own research work during a dedicated session.

## Venue
The school will be held in person on the campus of Yachay Tech University from **22nd to 26th July 2024**. Yachay Tech is located in the beautiful area of Urcuquí, a place renowned for its pleasant weather conditions and its proximity to numerous tourist attractions, such as hot springs, lakes, mountains, and active and inactive volcanoes.

#### Address
Yachay Tech University, School of Physical Sciences and Nanotechnology, Hacienda San José S/N, 100119 Urcuquí, Ecuador

#### Website

**Dates**: 22 - 26th July 2024

**Format**: In person

**Duration**: 5 days

**Time investment**: 40 hours

**Cost**: there is no registration fee

## Deadline
The applications for EPIC 4 are open until **10th June, 2024**. Please submit your application via Indico.

## Grants
The number of participants of EPIC 4 will be limited to the 20 most motivated students. Preference will be given to BSc students in their mid to last semesters, to MSc students, and to those who have not participated in previous editions of EPIC (EPIC 1 or EPIC 2). Accommodation (in a shared residency) will be provided (free of charge) by the host institution (UIDE) to all selected participants. Some scholarships to cover meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) will also be available to participants who require them, but keep in mind that scholarships to cover meals and travel costs may only be available for a very limited number of participants. Participants (or their universities) are expected to bear the costs of travel from their respective universities to UIDE's campus in Quito. However, a few travel grants might be available. **When you submit your application, please indicate the kind of financial support that you would require to attend EPIC 4.** There is no registration fee.


## Certificate
Students who attend and complete the course will receive an ICTP-PWF and UNESCO signed certificate.
