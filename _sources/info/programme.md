09h40 - 10h20: Plenary Talk: 2D Nanoelectrods for single module junctions (Henrry Osorio, Escuela Politécnica Nacional)

Molecular electronics, which applies individual molecules located between two or three fixed electrodes to construct an electronic device, has the potential to offer novel technological opportunities. Noble metal electrodes, especially gold, have been extensively used to comprehend the charge transport at metal-molecule-metal junctions. However, there are potential drawbacks of using gold electrodes such as non-compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, surface mobility and high price. In this context, the use of non-metallic electrodes has attracted growing attention as a result of the emergence of new properties and to avoid the use of rare, expensive and potentially toxic materials. Nevertheless, recently used non-metallic novel electrodes in this field, graphene or GaAs, need expensive methods for deposition or to provide optimal electrical contact. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to form and characterize non-symmetric molecular junctions in a simple way using scanning probe microscopy-based methods. Electrical properties of graphene-molecule-gold and MoS2-molecule-gold junctions will be discussed. In both cases, simple exfoliation techniques were used to obtain the non-metallic electrode. In summary, this study paves the way for the use of nanoelectrodes based on 2D-materials to construct single molecule junctions and evaluate charge transport at the molecular level.
