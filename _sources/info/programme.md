In this session, we will delve into the intricate world of programming a neural network from scratch, bypassing the convenience of pre-built libraries. Our journey will emphasize the mathematical foundations underpinning neural networks, providing a thorough understanding of how these powerful models function at a granular level. We will explore key concepts such as linear transformations, activation functions, forward and backward propagation, and gradient descent. By the end of the class, attendees will have a concrete understanding of the inner workings of neural networks and will be equipped with the skills to implement them using only basic programming constructs. This hands-on approach will demystify the algorithms and techniques that drive modern artificial intelligence, fostering a deeper appreciation for the complexity and elegance of neural network design.

Molecular electronics, which applies individual molecules located between two or three fixed electrodes to construct an electronic device, has the potential to offer novel technological opportunities. Noble metal electrodes, especially gold, have been extensively used to comprehend the charge transport at metal-molecule-metal junctions. However, there are potential drawbacks of using gold electrodes such as non-compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, surface mobility and high price. In this context, the use of non-metallic electrodes has attracted growing attention as a result of the emergence of new properties and to avoid the use of rare, expensive and potentially toxic materials. Nevertheless, recently used non-metallic novel electrodes in this field, graphene or GaAs, need expensive methods for deposition or to provide optimal electrical contact. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to form and characterize non-symmetric molecular junctions in a simple way using scanning probe microscopy-based methods. Electrical properties of graphene-molecule-gold and MoS2-molecule-gold junctions will be discussed. In both cases, simple exfoliation techniques were used to obtain the non-metallic electrode. In summary, this study paves the way for the use of nanoelectrodes based on 2D-materials to construct single molecule junctions and evaluate charge transport at the molecular level.
