#### Advanced topics on Computational Physics Tools and Machine Learning

08h30 - 10h00: Student contributed talks (7 min + 3 min each)

•⁠ 08h30 - 08h40: Atomistic study of the effect of composition on the structural and thermodynamic properties of binary Al-Pd nanoalloys (Dario Gonzalo Escriba, UNMSM)

Intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) are of great interest due to the unique properties brought by their composition and structure. This is reflected, for example, in their higher thermal stability and the potential to enhance their catalytic activity by varying the stoichiometry and size of the NPs. In particular, Al-Pd intermetallic NPs have diverse applications, from biomedical applications due to their ultra-low magnetic susceptibility, to applications in renewable energies due to their larger surface area, providing excellent selectivity in catalysis processes. However, this system has been quite controversial due to the complexity of its phase diagram and its limits. For these reasons, the objective of this work is to calculate the thermal and structural properties of Al-Pd NPs for various sizes and concentrations ranging from 10% to 90% Al with a 10% step, using atomistic simulation with the molecular dynamics method, starting from a random distribution of Al and Pd atoms in an NP with an initial FCC structure. To achieve this, the heating and cooling stages of the system were simulated using the LAMMPS package with the interatomic potential of the embedded atom method (EAM). Additionally, for visualization and determination of certain properties, various tools of the OVITO software were used, such as the common neighbor analysis (CNA) technique and the radial distribution function (RDF). The preliminary results obtained show, from the calculation of heat capacity, for each composition, the directly proportional relationship of the melting temperature with the nanoparticle size, which tends toward the macroscopic value. Furthermore, for the AlPd nanoalloy, an ordered intermetallic compound has formed, where each Al atom is surrounded by Pd atoms and vice versa, whose lattice parameter and theoretically calculated periodic structure are in agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, the thermal hysteresis curve for each composition and size is well defined only after reheating, indicating that the optimized structure after cooling is suitable and characteristic of the system. Finally, part of the system characterization includes the analysis and graphs obtained from the Lindemann index data, Mean Square Displacement (MSD), and radius of gyration provided by LAMMPS. As well as the calculation of phonon dispersion, which helped determine the dynamic stability of the phases to be simulated.

•⁠ 08h40 - 08h50: Analysis of the Folding process of a small polypeptide using molecular dynamic simulations (Tatiana Cabrera, EPN)

Biomolecules naturally fold into precise three-dimensional structures under physiological conditions to perform their biological functions. The process of folding is an interdisciplinary problem of great interest because the mechanisms behind it remain unclear. In this study, we investigated this process using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the deca-alanine system in water. The simulations were carried out using the software NAMD, followed by visualisation and data analysis with the software VMD and the TCL language. A preliminary simulation was conducted to sample the configuration space between the folded and unfolded states. This data was then analysed using cluster analysis in R, which identified eleven groups that characterise the regions of configurational space visited by deca-alanine during folding. This information was subsequently used to perform umbrella sampling of the folding process, with the representative configuration of each group used to realise MD simulations of sampling. This resulted in a probability distribution of the end-to-end distance accessed by the polypeptide. The distribution was then employed to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) utilising the weighted histogram analysis method implemented in a C++ program. The calculated PMF is consistent with the spontaneous nature of the folding process and describes a trajectory in configuration space that differs from those previously reported.

•⁠ 08h50 - 09h00: Role of Charging in Organometallic Overlayer On-Surface Self-Assembly (Yordan Solórzano, YT)

Recent developments in microscopic methods such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and CO-functionalized non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (nc-AFM) provide a direct insight into the chemical composition of technologically relevant self-assembled overlayers formed on the surface. An in-depth comprehension of the intermolecular associations occurring on a surface holds the potential to anticipate the arrangement, alignment, and electrical conductivity characteristics of films. Moreover, it facilitates the customization of novel molecular compositions that are specifically engineered for a desired purpose. In this work, we will combine state-of-the-art STM and nc-AFM measurements with theoretical models based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and STM/nc-AFM simulations to provide insight into the driving mechanisms behind the formation of different organometallic overlayers.

•⁠ 09h00 - 09h10: Brief analysis of rainfall series measured in Quito (Luis Gualco Centeno, EPN)

•⁠ 09h10 - 09h20: Efectos sísmico-electromagnéticos en la detección de rayos cósmicos (James Peñafiel, USFQ)

El siguiente proyecto se enfoca en evaluar la viabilidad de detectar, a nivel de superficie terrestre, las variaciones en el flujo de partículas secundarias de rayos cósmicos atribuibles a modificaciones del campo geo-electromagnético provocadas por la actividad sísmica. Para ello, se ejecutarán diversos ambientes de simulaciones computacionales y se analizarán los datos obtenidos enfocándose en el estudio de incertidumbres sistemáticas y estadísticas, para determinar la viabilidad de replicar estas mediciones en entornos reales.

•⁠ 09h20 - 09h30: Scalar and Tensor Power Spectrum of the Higgs inflationary model using Numerical Solution (Mariannly Marquez, YT)

In this research project, we aim to analyze the predictions of the Higgs inflationary model by comparing them with observational data from the Planck 2018 satellite. We intend to solve the scalar and tensor perturbations equations using numerical integration approaches. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of these numerical integration methods in reproducing the scalar power spectra, the scalar spectral index, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We expect to assess the consistency of the Higgs inflationary model with the latest cosmological observations. This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the model's viability and contribute to the ongoing research in cosmological inflation theories.

•⁠ 09h30 - 09h40: Some inflationary models under the light of Planck 2018 results (Jordan Zambrano, YT)

In this work we study four well–known inflationary scenarios that are
reported by the most recent Planck observations: Natural inflation, Hilltop quartic inflation, Starobinsky inflationary model, and Large field power–law potentials V (ϕ) ∼ ϕ^{p}, considering p = 2/3, 4/3. The analysis is done using both the slow–roll approximation and the numerical solution to the background and perturbation equations. We show that the numerical solution improved the precision of these models with respect to the contour plot r vs. nS, having a lower r in each model compared to the value calculated from the slow–roll approximation.

•⁠ 09h40 - 09h50: Study of acausally displaced vertices from Lee-Wick particle decays with LHC open data (Jonathan Joel Sánchez Jácome, YT)

We investigated the viability of reconstructing and identifying acausally displaced vertices predicted by the Lee-Wick (LW) standard model (LWSM). This theory correct divergence problems in the standard model with the addition of new partner fields with negative metric. The model predicts a phenomenon termed as wrong displaced vertices (WDV) because it seems to defy micro causality. In this work, we studied the decay of Lee-Wick partners of the electron (LW-electrons) emitted from a Z boson decay, presumably the most probable channel. We generated the model with mass values of the LW-electron 200-500 GeV using Feynrules and Madgraph according to LHC Run-1 conditions. The highest calculated cross-section (5.97 fb) corresponds to 200 GeV, with an average flight distance of 2.7e-2 mm—greater than the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) tracker system resolution. We found that the signals for mass values of 300, 400, and 500 GeV are less likely to be observed. The immediate decay consists of a pair of highly energetic electrons and a pair of Z-bosons emerging from a pair of wrongly displaced vertices. The detection and reconstruction were simulated in the CMS-software-5.3.32. We characterized the final topology, identifying two energetic electrons and partially identifying four jets emerging from Z boson decay. Other final topologies are being studied. For the first time, we defined the quantity parallelity as the dot product between total momentum of the decaying products and propagation vector of the mother particle. Asymmetries in the parallelity distribution suggest the feasibility of measuring wrong displaced vertices if they are present in experimental data.

•⁠ 09h50 - 10h00: Estudio de la disipación de la energúa durante las medidas en los procesadores cuánticos debido al principio de Landauer (Jorge Cedeño, ESPOCH)

Las aplicaciones de puertas lógicas cuánticas no ideales provocan disipaciones de energía que están acotadas desde abajo por la variación en la entropía de von Neumann debido al principio de Landauer cuántico, así, con el fin de comprender como evoluciona la información cuántica al ser eliminada, el objetivo de esta investigación fue estudiar la disipación de energía al ejecutar medidas en los procesadores cuánticos. La metodología implementada tuvo un enfoque cualitativo, llevando como principal factor de aplicación la mitigación de errores cuánticos, generando dos grupos de circuitos cuánticos al mitigar y no mitigar los resultados. Además, la información contenida en los qubits, denominados sistema y reservorio, fue reconstruida mediante la tomografía de estados cuánticos antes y después de aplicar el protocolo de eliminación. Todos estos circuitos cuánticos fueron ejecutados a través de una simulación computacional utilizando la librería Qiskit de IBM. Mediante esta metodología, el incremento del parámetro de entrelazamiento entre los qubits provocó un aumento en la entropía y una disminución de la información inicial contenida en el sistema, a la vez que posicionó la cantidad de energía disipada al reservorio a niveles inferiores, iguales y superiores al límite de disipación clásica de Landauer. Adicionalmente, al implementar la mitigación se redujo las entropías iniciales, aumentando la variación de entropía, sin embargo, la información del sistema fue trasladada a niveles más bajos de fidelidades, provocando un proceso irreversible de pérdida de información. En este contexto se concluye que el límite clásico de Landauer, en el mundo cuántico, funge como una aparente frontera entre los procesamientos de información reversibles e irreversibles. Por otro lado, aunque la mitigación provocó un acercamiento a la irreversibilidad, su aplicación nos llevó a la definición del defecto de medida, que proporciona una herramienta matemática que caracteriza la calidad de las mediciones en determinados procesadores cuánticos.

10h00 - 10h40: Plenary Talk: 2D Nanoelectrods for single module junctions (Henrry Osorio, Escuela Politécnica Nacional)

Molecular electronics, which applies individual molecules located between two or three fixed electrodes to construct an electronic device, has the potential to offer novel technological opportunities. Noble metal electrodes, especially gold, have been extensively used to comprehend the charge transport at metal-molecule-metal junctions. However, there are potential drawbacks of using gold electrodes such as non-compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, surface mobility and high price. In this context, the use of non-metallic electrodes has attracted growing attention as a result of the emergence of new properties and to avoid the use of rare, expensive and potentially toxic materials. Nevertheless, recently used non-metallic novel electrodes in this field, graphene or GaAs, need expensive methods for deposition or to provide optimal electrical contact. In this talk, I will describe our efforts to form and characterize non-symmetric molecular junctions in a simple way using scanning probe microscopy-based methods. Electrical properties of graphene-molecule-gold and MoS2-molecule-gold junctions will be discussed. In both cases, simple exfoliation techniques were used to obtain the non-metallic electrode. In summary, this study paves the way for the use of nanoelectrodes based on 2D-materials to construct single molecule junctions and evaluate charge transport at the molecular level.
